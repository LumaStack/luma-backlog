The finite-decimal property of the current scheme is written into the record as input rather than as a constraint --- explicitly flagged as describing the thing being reconsidered, with the note that a scheme making the question meaningless is a better answer than one satisfying it. The shared-position-plus-stamp hunch has no arithmetic at all and an integer scheme with a periodic renumber has no precision to extend, so it applies to neither. The guard against the hang landed separately and commits to no scheme: a bounded search that rounds and reports beats a process that never returns.

### Explored where the incumbent breaks, and found a live defect doing it

**The headline: it fails at about two hundred moves, not at a million.**
Prepending bisects from the very first move, because the seed sits one step
above zero and there is nowhere to step down into --- so moving work to the
front, the most ordinary reordering anybody does, is the cheapest way to
exhaust the scheme. Appending gets 999 free integer steps and then decays the
same way, out at ~1200. Full numbers in
[[work-items/WORK-0096-what-repeated-reordering-does-to-the-rank-key/explorations/where-the-current-rank-scheme-actually-breaks]].

**The question "what happens at a million" has no interesting answer.** Keys
grow one digit per move and time grows as the square --- 2,925 moves took 25
seconds and produced a 2,929-character key. A million is a megabyte-long
ordering key and about a month of arithmetic. The scheme leaves the usable range
three orders of magnitude before the question applies.

**And the precision bound added hours earlier was actively harmful.** It rounded
at sixty places, and a rounded position equals the neighbor it was meant to sit
beside --- so allocation began handing out positions another record already
held, with the order silently gone. Every append past n≈1100 returned
`9999.9999`; every prepend past n≈100 returned the same value. **A hang was the
better failure**, which is not a defence of the hang: `Between` now verifies
that what it allocated falls strictly where it was asked to, and refuses naming
`rank repair`. The recovery loop is verified end to end against the binary.

**Two process notes worth keeping.** The first CLI check appeared to pass
because `go build -o` from outside the module had silently failed with stderr
suppressed, so I was testing a stale binary --- exactly what
`docs/development.md` warns a kept binary costs. And I only found the silent
collision because the measurement stopped growing; had I measured only time or
only correctness, it would have read as success.
